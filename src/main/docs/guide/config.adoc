Now that we have a unified Gradle build target, we have a couple more configuration changes to make. All of these changes
have to do with the URL differences between the separate Grails & Vue apps and our new combined deployment.

By default, static resources in a deployed Grails app are served from the  `/static` base URL. That will conflict with
what our Vue app expects, but fortunately, this is a very simple change.

Edit `server/grails-app/conf/application.yml`:
[source,yml]
.server/grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0, tag=grailsResourcesPattern]
----

This simply sets the static resources URL to be set to the root context.

Along similar lines, we need to edit the URL that the Vue app uses to make REST calls against the Grails app.
This can be done within `src/config.js` in the `client` project.

Edit `client/src/config.js`:
[source,javascript]
.client/src/config.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/config.js[indent=0]

<1> The `process.env.NODE_ENV` is a NodeJS environment variable that will tell us if we are running in production or development mode. We're using a simple ternary operator to switch the `SERVER_URL` config property to point to our standalone Grails app during development, and to use the root context in production.
