If you open the `initial` project of this guide, you will find a plain project
generated from the Vue profile.

Both the `server` Grails app and the `client` Vue app have `production`
build tasks set up - you can run `./gradlew server:assemble` to build a WAR or
JAR file, and you can run `yarn build` (or `./gradlew client:build`) to generate
a static Vue/webpack bundle.
Our first step is to create a new `build.gradle` file at the top of our project
structure, above the `client` and `server` sub-projects.
